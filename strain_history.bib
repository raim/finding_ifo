                   oscillation was found in a continuous culture of
                   yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under aerobic
                   conditions at low-dilution rates. During oscillation,
                   many parameters changed cyclically, such as dissolved
                   oxygen concentration, respiration rate, ethanol and
                   acetate concentrations in the culture, glycogen, ATP,
                   NADH, pyruvate and acetate concentrations in the
                   cells. These changes were considered to be associated
                   with glycogen metabolism. When glycogen was degraded,
                   the respiro-fermentative phase was observed, in which
                   ethanol was produced and the respiration rate
                   decreased. In this phase, the levels of intracellular
                   pyruvate and acetate became minimum, ATP became high
                   and intracellular pH at its lowest level. When
                   glycogen metabolism changed from degradation to
                   accumulation, the respiratory phase started, during
                   which ethanol was re-assimilated from the culture and
                   the respiration rate increased. Intracellular
                   pyruvate and acetate became maximum, ATP decreased
                   and the intracellular pH appeared high. These
                   findings may indicate new aspects of the control
                   mechanism of glycogen metabolism and how respiration
                   and ethanol fermentation are regulated together under
                   aerobic conditions.},

                   under aerobic continuous culture, an autonomous
                   short-period-sustained oscillation appeared. This
                   oscillation was observed in concentrations of various
                   extracellular and intracellular parameters, such as
                   ethanol, acetate, glycogen, dissolved oxygen and
                   intracellular pH. In this work the synchronization
                   affecter of this oscillation was investigated.
                   Ethanol was found not to be the synchronizer of the
                   oscillation because a pulse of ethanol did not affect
                   the phase or period of the oscillation. The
                   oscillation was dependent on the aeration rate, i.e.,
                   the oscillation occurred only between 150 and 600 ml
                   min-1. However, the oxygen concentration did not
                   influence synchronization as an upward shift in the
                   oxygen concentration of the gas flow did not affect
                   the sustainability of the oscillation. On the other
                   hand, synchronization was stopped by an enhanced gas
                   flow rate, keeping dissolved oxygen tension at the
                   oscillatory condition, suggesting that
                   synchronization was caused by a volatile compound in
                   the culture. A stepwise increase in carbon dioxide
                   concentration of the gas flow rate ceased
                   synchronization, yet the oscillation seem to continue
                   in each individual cell. Oscillatory behaviour of
                   intracellular pH and carbon dioxide evolution rate
                   showed a phase difference of 90 degrees. Based on
                   these facts it is postulated that carbon dioxide,
                   through the influence of its dissociation on
                   intracellular pH, could be the synchronization
                   affector of the autonomous short-period-sustained
                   oscillation of S. cerevisiae.},

                   the characteristics of a continuous propagator.
                   Laboratory apparatus was developed which allowed
                   sterile propagation of aerobic microorganisms in a
                   stirred-tank reactor of the overflow type. Using Ps.
                   fluorescens, B. linens, and a strain of S.
                   carlsbergensis a theoretical relation was shown
                   between the mean retention time of the cells in the
                   propagator and their growth rate. By proper
                   adjustment of the flow rates, steady populations were
                   attained. In incompletely buffered media, a steady
                   cycling in yeast population was observed, which was
                   traced to steady fluctuations in the pH which were 90
                   degrees out of phase with fluctuations in population.
                   The phenomenon appears to arise from the inherent
                   feedback in the system coupled with a metabolic lag.
                   Fermentation of the medium was not complete, as only
                   the propagation of cells was of interest. In a
                   practical process additional holding tanks would be
                   provided, so that end products could be obtained in

                   synchronous growth of baker's yeast with asymmetric
                   budding cycle is developed and solved analytically.
                   The model is able to describe sustained oscillations
                   with constant shape and amplitude in the number of
                   cells in different intervals of the cell cycle. It is
                   shown that many characteristics of the oscillations
                   are already completely determined by the population
                   balances and are independent of cell metabolism. The
                   model predicts that the oscillation period is
                   proportional to the average doubling time, but
                   multiple modes of oscillation with different
                   frequency exist. The oscillation period is always
                   smaller or at least equal to the doubling time. Under
                   synchronized growth, the length of the parent and
                   daughter cycles are multiples of the oscillation
                   period and deviate from asynchronous growth.
                   Expressions for the development in time of averaged
                   population variables, such as the cell number in
                   different intervals of the cell cycle, are derived
                   for an arbitrary shape of the age distribution.
                   Completely synchronized growth with Dirac delta age
                   distribution is considered in more detail. It is
                   shown that the average fraction of budding cells
                   during synchronized growth is increased over the
                   value for asynchronous growth. The amplitude of the
                   oscillation on population variables decreases with
                   increasing frequency.},

                   yeast with sustained synchronous oscillations is
                   further evaluated to predict the permissible region
                   of doubling times for the oscillations, the preferred
                   region, and the preferred mode of oscillation. The
                   comparison of model predictions and experimental data
                   reveals that sustained oscillations can only exist in
                   a region where the length of the parent cycle is
                   increased, and the length of the daughter cycle is
                   decreased, in reference to asynchronous growth. While
                   the oscillation frequency is given by the lengths of
                   the parent and daughter cycles together with the
                   average doubling time, the preferred region of
                   oscillations of a certain mode is determined by the
                   length of the budding phase which also controls the
                   oscillation amplitude and the increase in the average
                   fraction of budding cells over asynchronous growth.
                   From these two parameters, the preferred region of
                   the oscillations is predicted and compares well to
                   experimental data. The validity of the model is
                   further tested by dynamic simulations of synchronous
                   growth. The inherent structure of the model allows a
                   clear separation of cell cycle related parameters and
                   of the age distribution of the population, by which
                   the identification of both from experimental data is
                   greatly facilitated. The predicted tendency of the
                   oscillation amplitude in dependency on the
                   oscillation frequency is also in good agreement with
                   experimental data for the CO2 evolution. The
                   theoretical analysis shows that two different types
                   of synchronous oscillations exist under excess of
                   oxygen and oxygen limitation. The latter one, with
                   oscillation periods greater than the doubling time,
                   cannot be explained by the model.},

                   models in which a key cell cycle parameter is a
                   function of the environmental conditions, e.g., the
                   concentration of a substrate or product. Although
                   these models are remarkably simple, they can display
                   a wide range of dynamic behaviors. These behaviors
                   include, for binary fission organisms, solutions
                   containing a single synchronous population and, for
                   budding yeasts, two synchronized subpopulations with
                   a period of oscillation similar to that of the cell
                   cycle length, a pattern that has been observed
                   experimentally in S. cerevisiae. Numerical
                   simulations of the model equations also show that
                   complex periodic solutions with periods very
                   different from the cell cycle length are possible.
                   The ability of the population balance approach to
                   accurately describe the available data of yeast
                   culture dynamics will be discussed.},

                   obtained from the bioenergetic oscillatory outputs of
                   Saccharomyces cerevisiae and isolated cardiomyocytes
                   utilizing Relative Dispersional (RDA) and Power
                   Spectral (PSA) analyses. These analyses revealed
                   broad frequency distributions and evidence for
                   long-term memory in the observed dynamics. Moreover
                   RDA and PSA showed that the bioenergetic dynamics in
                   both systems show fractal scaling over at least 3
                   orders of magnitude, and that this scaling obeys an
                   inverse power law. Therefore we conclude that in S.
                   cerevisiae and cardiomyocytes the dynamics are
                   scale-free in vivo. Applying RDA and PSA to data
                   generated from an in silico model of mitochondrial
                   function indicated that in yeast and cardiomyocytes
                   the underlying mechanisms regulating the scale-free
                   behavior are similar. We validated this finding in
                   vivo using single cells, and attenuating the activity
                   of the mitochondrial inner membrane anion channel
                   with 4-chlorodiazepam to show that the oscillation of
                   NAD(P)H and reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be
                   abated in these two evolutionarily distant species.
                   Taken together these data strongly support our
                   hypothesis that the generation of ROS, coupled to
                   redox cycling, driven by cytoplasmic and
                   mitochondrial processes, are at the core of the
                   observed rhythmicity and scale-free dynamics. We
                   argue that the operation of scale-free bioenergetic
                   dynamics plays a fundamental role to integrate
                   cellular function, while providing a framework for

                   Although nutrient supply is constant, cells sequester

                   Replete stores trigger increased H(+) export which

                   fundamental cellular processes. The oscillation
                   percolates throughout cellular physiology, and the
                   transcriptome oscillates between expression of genes
                   encoding for biosynthesis and growth, and for
                   catabolism and stress-response. However, long protein
                   half-lives dampen this oscillation of transcript
                   abundances, and putative functions remain elusive. We
                   analyze an RNA-seq time series over 2.5 cycles of a
                   short period respiratory oscillation (≈ 36 min,
                   strain IFO 0233), preceding a distinct bifurcation of

                   media studied from a GRR specific to the carbon
                   source. Genes with positive universal GRR include
                   ribosomal, translation, and mitochondrial genes, and
                   those with negative GRR include autophagy, vacuolar,
                   and stress response genes. The carbon source-specific
                   GRR genes control mitochondrial function,

                   oxidative metabolism. All genes with universal GRR,
                   which comprise 25\% of the genome, are expressed
                   periodically in the yeast metabolic cycle (YMC). We

                   coincide exactly with the S phase of the cell

                   division cycle (CDC) and the yeast metabolic cycle
                   (YMC), in budding yeast. Previous work suggested that
                   the CDC and YMC interact to separate high oxygen
                   consumption (HOC) from DNA replication to prevent
                   genetic damage. To test this hypothesis, we grew
                   diverse strains in chemostat and measured DNA
                   replication and oxygen consumption with high temporal
                   resolution at different growth rates. Our data showed
                   that HOC is not strictly separated from DNA
                   replication; rather, cell cycle Start is coupled with
                   the initiation of HOC and catabolism of storage
                   carbohydrates. The logic of this YMC-CDC coupling may
                   be to ensure that DNA replication and cell division
                   occur only when sufficient cellular energy reserves
                   have accumulated. Our results also uncovered a
                   quantitative relationship between CDC period and YMC

                   with alternating metabolic activity of the two
                   superclusters and differential feedback on their
                   transcription via activating (RSC) and repressive
                   (Isw2) types of promoter structure remodeling. We
                   propose a novel feedback mechanism, where the
                   energetic state of the cell, reflected in the ATP:ADP
                   ratio, gates the transcription of large, but
                   functionally coherent groups of genes via
                   differential effects of ATP-dependent nucleosome
                   remodeling machineries. Besides providing a
                   mechanistic hypothesis for the delayed negative
                   feedback that results in the oscillatory phenotype,
                   this mechanism may underpin the continuous adaptation
                   of growth to environmental conditions.},

                   a robust autonomous temperature compensated
                   oscillation in many metabolic functions. Respiratory
                   activity, a convenient output to measure, oscillates
                   with a period of 40 min. Deletion of GTS1, whose
                   protein product has homology to the circadian per
                   protein, has been implicated in temporal events
                   within yeast, causes a reduction in periodicity to 18
                   min (wild-type period 40-60 min). The dilution rate
                   was steadily increased from 0.04/h to 0.085/h and the
                   oscillation stabilized after four to six dilutions.
                   However, Gts1p's involvement in the maintenance and
                   generation of metabolic synchrony, and in the central
                   oscillating loop, appear to be minimal, as the mutant

                   GTS1 did cause decreased temperature compensation of
                   the period of the oscillation from Q(10) = 1.07 for
                   the wild-type to Q(10) = 1.6 for the mutant. Also the

                   more catalase when grown under 100\% O(2) than when
                   grown anaerobically. Growth under oxygen caused equal
                   increases in both the cyanide-sensitive and the
                   cyanide-insensitive superoxide dismutases of this
                   organism. Experience with other eukaryotes has shown
                   that cyanide sensitivity is a property of the
                   cupro-zinc superoxide dismutase of the cytosol,
                   whereas cyanide insensitivity is a property of the
                   corresponding mangani-enzyme found in mitochondria.
                   Cu(2+), which has been shown to increase the
                   radioresistance of yeast, also caused an increase of
                   both of the superoxide dismutases of S. cerevisiae.
                   Yeast which had been grown under 1 atm of O(2) were
                   more resistant toward the lethal effects of 20 atm of
                   O(2) than were yeast which had been grown in the
                   absence of O(2). Escherichia coli K-12 his(-)
                   responded to growth under 1 atm of O(2) by increasing
                   its content of catalase and of peroxidase, but not of
                   superoxide dismutase. This contrasts with E. coli B,
                   which was previously shown to respond to O(2) by a
                   striking increase in superoxide dismutase. E. coli
                   K-12 his(-) did not gain resistance toward 20 atm of
                   O(2) because of having been grown under 1 atm of
                   O(2). Once again, this contrasts with the behavior of
                   E. coli B. These data indicate that, in both
                   prokaryotes and in eukaryotes, superoxide dismutase
                   is an important component of the defenses against
                   oxygen toxicity.},

                   0233, growing with glucose as the major carbon and
                   energy source, shows oscillations of respiration with
                   a period of 48 min. Samples taken at maxima and
                   minima indicate that (i) periodic changes do not
                   occur as a result of carbon depletion, (ii) intrinsic
                   differences in respiratory activity occur in washed
                   organisms and (iii) a respiratory inhibitor
                   accumulates during respiratory oscillations. Plasma
                   membrane and inner mitochondrial membranes generate
                   transmembrane electrochemical potentials; changes in
                   these can be respectively assessed using anionic or
                   cationic fluorophores. Thus flow cytometric analyses
                   indicated that an oxonol dye [DiBAC(4)(3);
                   bis(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol] was
                   excluded from yeasts to a similar extent (in >98\% of
                   the population) at all stages, showing that the
                   plasma membrane potential was maintained at a steady
                   value. However, uptake of Rhodamine 123 was greatest
                   at that phase characterized by a low respiratory
                   rate. Addition of uncouplers of energy conservation
                   [CCCP (m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone) or
  S-13(5-chloro-3-t-butyl-2-chloro-4(1)-nitrosalicylanilide)] to the continuous
  cultures increased the respiration, but had only a transient effect on the
  period of the oscillation. Electron microscopy showed changes in
  mitochondrial ultrastructure during the respiratory oscillation. At low
  respiration the cristae were more clearly defined due to swelling of the
  matrix; this corresponds to the 'orthodox' conformation. When respiration was
  high the mitochondrial configuration was 'condensed'. It has been shown
  previously that a temperature-compensated ultradian clock operates in S.
  cerevisiae. It is proposed that mitochondria undergo cycles of energization
  in response to energetic demands driven by this ultradian clock output.},
